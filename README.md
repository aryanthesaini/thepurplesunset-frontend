# Tech Stack used : NextJs, Strapi, Styled Components, GraphQL


I used Render to provide me with a free database and integrated it with my stripe application that saved me the trouble of creating the back-end from scratch. 

Afer adding a blueprint of the dataset that I will provide the application with, I got the APIs and used them to fetch data on to my front-end

Used NextJs to ensure the webapp is fast. Used hooks and logics to ensure the functionality of the site is not compromised. 

Used Stripe to add payment gateway and make it secure and smooth. 

Deployed on vercel and added a custom domain. 

The process was so much more than it seems, a lot of roadblocks and challenges but overall it works fine so yay!
